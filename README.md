# BankAccount

A small learning project that provides a simple BankAccount implementation and example usage for basic banking operations (deposit, withdraw, balance inquiry, and transfers).

## Overview

This repository contains a straightforward BankAccount implementation intended for learning, testing, and demonstration purposes. It includes:
- A BankAccount class (or equivalent) implementing deposit, withdraw, and balance checks
- Input validation and basic error handling (e.g., insufficient funds)
- Example usage / basic tests to demonstrate typical operations

## Features

- Create accounts with an owner name and optional initial balance
- Deposit and withdraw funds with validation
- Balance inquiry
- (Optional) Transfer funds between accounts
- Simple, easy-to-read implementation suitable for adaptation to many languages

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rabinwaiba123/BankAccount.git
cd BankAccount
```

2. Inspect the repository to determine the implementation language and entry point (look for files such as `bank_account.py`, `BankAccount.java`, `index.js`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, etc.).

3. Run the project using the appropriate toolchain for the language found in the repository:

- Python (example):

```bash
python3 bank_account.py
# or if the project uses a package:
python3 -m src.main
```

- Node.js / JavaScript (example):

```bash
npm install
node index.js
# or
npm start
```

- Java (example):

```bash
javac BankAccount.java
java BankAccount
```

- C# / .NET (example):

```bash
dotnet run
```

If you're unsure which command to run, open the repository files and look for a README-specific or language-specific file (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`).

## Usage example (pseudo-code)

```pseudo
# pseudo-code example - replace with language-specific usage
account = BankAccount("Alice", initial_balance=100)
account.deposit(50)
account.withdraw(30)
print(account.balance)  # expected: 120
```

If you tell me the language or point me to the main file, I can replace the pseudo-code above with the exact usage for this repository.

## Running tests

If the repository includes tests, run them with the language's test runner:

- Python: `pytest` or `python -m unittest`
- Node.js: `npm test`
- Java (Maven): `mvn test`
- Java (Gradle): `gradle test`

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Commit your changes and push the branch
4. Open a pull request describing your changes
